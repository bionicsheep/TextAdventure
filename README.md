Commands are a max of two words so "open wooden dresser" would just be "open dresser" and "take metal key" would just be "take key".

Commands to play are "inventory", "examine", "take [object]", "east", "south", "north", "west", "open [object]", and "close [object]"

Added commands "display [object]", and "displayroom" for debugging sake.
